# Runlite GE automade trade tracker
this plugin, while enable, will automaticly track any and all trades you complete through the Grand exchange. It then sends these trades to your OSRS GE app P/L tracker to monitor your current trades. 

To set up the plugin, all you need to do is intall it and enable it in your plugins tab. Then, go to the OSRS GE tracker and link your runescape ingame name (exactly how it is written). Your open trades will now be tracked in the P/L tracker. You can track openings of new trades, or even add on to existing trades.
